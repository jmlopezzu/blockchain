Here's an example of a basic blockchain visualization app using Streamlit in Python. This app allows you to interact with a simplified blockchain by adding new blocks and viewing the blockchain's contents.

To run this code, make sure you have Streamlit installed (pip install streamlit) and then save the code to a file with a .py extension (e.g., blockchain_app.py). Run the app using the command streamlit run blockchain_app.py in your terminal.

This code defines a Streamlit app that lets you interactively add blocks to the blockchain and view their details. You can specify the number of blocks to add and click the "Add Blocks" button to see the blockchain's progression.

Remember that this app is a simplified visualization for educational purposes and doesn't cover the complexity of real-world blockchain applications.
